# notes
I had a lot of trouble getting the logic correct for my writeLine function and spent most of my time trying to figure out the best way to implement it so that it worked correctly each time. Once I got it to a working state I was relieved, but I think I need to spend more time working with objects to truly grasp how to better solve this problem in the future. I'll keep working on these and the modules provided by Fullstack Academy to further my working knowledge of objects.
